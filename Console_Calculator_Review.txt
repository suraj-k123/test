Solution looks good and have all the functionalities.

Have couple of suggestions.
1. Avoid writing redundant code in your solution.
     In each case when you have written same reading statements, Why canot you move them out of switch.
                        Console.Write("Please Enter value1 : ");
                        num1 = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());

                        Console.Write("Please Enter Value2 : ");
                        num2 = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());

2. Avoid un necessary readline. You have added readline in each case.when one operaton completed you have to ask for continue/Not. One extra readline in between will confuse the user(Not exactly sure what to do).
                        Console.Write("Sum is : ");
                        Console.WriteLine(num1 + num2);
                        Console.ReadLine();
